I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Heading, Paragraphs and Links","number":"4","start":584.2,"end":587.0,"text":" Which is also called inline CSS."},{"title":"Inline, Internal & External CSS","number":"15","start":238.0,"end":240.0,"text":" This is called inline CSS."},{"title":"Heading, Paragraphs and Links","number":"4","start":593.0,"end":594.4,"text":" This is also called inline CSS."},{"title":"Inline, Internal & External CSS","number":"15","start":472.0,"end":473.0,"text":" that what is the difference between inline CSS,"},{"title":"Inline, Internal & External CSS","number":"15","start":308.0,"end":311.0,"text":" But how is this different from inline CSS?"}]
---------------------------------
"where is inline css tought "
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
